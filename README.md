# Covid Data Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analyze Covid data from Our World in Data in order to gain insights into the rate of infection and vaccination across different countries. Using Excel, PostgreSQL, and Tableau, we built a database of Covid data and created a dashboard for visualizing the data.

## Features

- View the rate of infection and vaccination per country
- Filter data by date range and country
- Compare trends over time
