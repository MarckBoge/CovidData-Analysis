# CovidData-Project

## Overview

The purpose for this project was to analyze Covid Data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). Using PostgresSQL I was able to build a database using the data provided to build tables to create a dashboard in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboard_16732440855680/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to show case the rate of infection and also the rate of vaccination per country. I was able to determine the percentage rate per country the amount of infection and how many have been vaccinated.
